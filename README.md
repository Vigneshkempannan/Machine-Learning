Data Analysis using Python - Evaluating the speed violations

Traffic management is the critical issue of theroad. With growth in traffic, there is occurrence ofbundle of problems too; these problems include traffic jams, accidents and traffic rule violation at the heavytraffic signals. Monitoring these traffic violations by human interventionover wide area is too complicated due to the increasingpopulation and vehicles. The speed of vehicle means onwhich speed vehicle moves on the road. Vehicle speed detection is very important for observing speed limitation law and it also demonstrates traffic condition.

Analysis from Dataset

1)Driver 65743 has maximum voilations ,Driver 11914 was the slowest driver.

2)Driver 1308317 has the minimum violations and has good adherence to the speed limit

3)All the drivers have violated the speed limit atleast once

4)Georgia is the state that has maximum speed limit with the least being NewYork

5)NewYork has high speed violations, and South Carolina has more number of Drivers violating the speed limit

6)There are high violations happening from 6AM -9AM and 8PM-10PM

7)More number of violations happens in August and september


Phishing Analysis

Phishing is an example of social engineering techniques being used to deceive users. Users are often lured by communications purporting to be from trusted parties such as social web sites, auction sites, banks, online payment processors or IT administrators.

Attempts to deal with phishing incidents include legislation, user training, public awareness, and technical security measures (the latter being due to phishing attacks frequently exploiting weaknesses in current web security).

Analyzing Phishing Dataset
1) On analyzing the dataset we can infer Links_in_tags, Page_Rank,web_traffic, DNSRecord,age_of_domain are the important features that can predict the phishing website

2) Use of BorutaPy to implement the feature selection

3) Use of Decision trees on Binary classification problem gives good accuracy and score.

4) Gradient Boost provides best scores while providing equal accuracy compared with Random Forest.
